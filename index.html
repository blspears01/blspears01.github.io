	<h3 class="margin">Introduction</h3>
	<p id="intro" class="margin">At the start of the quarter, I decided to make the topic of my Passion Project based around driving.
	I received my driving permit in July, and I slowed down on getting my hours completed when school started.
	By making this my Passion Project, I figured it would help motivate me to get back on track and to continue
	at a more consistent pace. After about 7 weeks in the quarter, I decided to include coding as part of it.
	I still had to find a way to present my original Passion Project about driving, so I thought that creating a wesbite
	would be an interesting way to show it.</p>
	<br></br>
	<h3 class="margin">Time and Effort</h3>
	<p id="timeeffort" class="margin">I would estimate that I spent about 25 hours total on this project, when considering 
	the driving time, videos I watched to learn about coding, and the actual amount of time I spent creating this website. 
	I wish I had come up with the idea to include coding sooner because I would have gone into more advanced features if I
	had more time. I also didn't realize how much I enjoyed doing it. Although the website looks pretty simple and unprofessional
	it took a TON of code to build.
	<br></br>
	<h3 class="margin">Reflection</h3>
	<p id="reflection" class="margin">Overall, I am very content with my project. I had a lot of fun coding and driving, although the driving
	got really stressful at times. I learned a lot about both of these skills throught the 10 weeks. 
	I became much more familiar with programming languages and the necessary components that make up a good website.
	I'm hoping that this new skill will lead to more advanced skills in the field of computer science or programming.
	In the future, I will probably try coding games or apps with more sophisticated languages.
	In addition, to the coding and driving, I have become better at problem solving and handling stressful situations.
	I am very content with the final product and impact. I go into more detail about these things in the links you can 
	click at the top.</p>
