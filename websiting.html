	<h3 class="margin">Summary</h3>
	<p id="summary" class="margin">To create this website, I took a course called 
		<a class="special" href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/website-coding/home/welcome">
		Responsive Website Basics: Code with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</a>. It's just a free course
		provided by the University of London that explains different aspects of creating a website.
		There are several different videos explaining the different programming langauges involved.
		It gave me a really good start on my project, but I Googled most of the information that I
		ended up using in this website. I watched about 3 hours of video from there because the instructors
		explain everything relatively well. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in coding
		websites, especially if you don't have any prior knowledge. For the actualy programming, I used
		an application called Notepad++. It is a very easy to use application. It took me no time at all
		to learn how to use it.
		</p>
	<h3 class="margin">Languages</h3>
	<p id="languages" class="margin">The course covered three programming languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
		HTML is the base of this website. It controls the basic functions of links, text, and images. CSS is
		the design aspect of it all. You can control anything from font to the position of an image. Bootstrap
		is an extremely helpful package of CSS that I used. It made this website look much better because 
		it gives it a more modern look. Normally, you would have to make custom code depending
		on the type of design you want, but Bootstrap is basically a package of preset code that you can use for free.
		Lastly, JavaScript was the most complicated programming language we covered. This is used for the most
		advanced things in a website. The only part of this website that actually uses JavaScript is the 
		<a class="special" href="picturegallery.html">Media</a> page.
		</p>
	<h3 class="margin">Progress</h3>
	<p id="progress" class="margin">By watching more and more videos and looking at other peoples' code, I learned
		a lot about formatting and how to write code efficiently. There are still parts that I made overly complex, but
		it was much worse at the start. As my familiarity with the different elements and features,
		I got a lot quicker at typing everything, and I started thinking about it less. However, when a problem arose
		I had to look through the whole thing again to spot the error, which required some deep problem solving.</p>
	<h3 class="margin">Challenges</h3>
	<p id="challenges" class="margin">
	Throughout the creation of this website, I went through at least 3 different websites. These became ruined because
	I typed some code that screwed everything up so badly that I had to restart. After the 3rd time I learned to
	create a practice file to make sure everything worked without compromising the function of other things. If it
	wasn't my code that screwed it up, it was some problem with file pathways. I found that the computer is extremely particular
	about the file pathways that are included, and it can cause everything to stop working, too. Another issue I encountered
	was publishing this to make it accessible to everyone in the class. It took a good bit of research to find a way to do this.
	</p>
	<h3 class="margin">Result</h3>
	<p id="result" class="margin">
	I am proud of the way this project turned out. Ideally, it would look more professional, but since I recently started
	I'll let it slide. To publish this, I used GitHub, which is a public platform to share and edit code with a large community.
	I only used it for the purpose of sharing.
